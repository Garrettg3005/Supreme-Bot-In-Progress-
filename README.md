Supreme Bot
In progress and INCOMPLETE. Made in Node.js.

To use this bot:

Method 1:

Run the JS file.
Use the correct pathing and run the file (ex: .atom/node scam_io.js)
A config file will be created.

Fill it out and try running the bot again.

Method 2:

Optional: Run `npm install`
Optional: Run `npm run eu` if you're from EU
Run `npm run us` if you're from US

A config file will be created. Enter information inside.

Finally,

Run `npm run eu` if you're from EU
Run `npm run us` if you're from US

Method 1 works best typically. Feel free to help me complete this :)
